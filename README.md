# Generalizability of Mixture of Domain-Specific Adapters from the Lens of Signed Weight Directions and its Application to Effective Model Pruning

We aim to provide comprehensive analysis to elucidate the generalizability of domain-specific adapter mixtures in in-domain evaluation. 
We also provide investigations into the inner workings of the mixture of domain-specific adapters by analyzing their weight signs, yielding critical analysis on the negative correlation between their fraction of weight sign difference and their mixturesâ€™ generalizability.
