# Generalizability of Mixture of Domain-Specific Adapters from the Lens of Signed Weight Directions and its Application to Effective Model Pruning

We aim to provide comprehensive analysis to elucidate the generalizability of domain-specific adapter mixtures in in-domain evaluation. 
We also provide investigations into the inner workings of the mixture of domain-specific adapters by analyzing their weight signs, yielding critical analysis on the negative correlation between their fraction of weight sign difference and their mixturesâ€™ generalizability. 

## Code and Dataset Release

We are currently in the final stages of preparing the OSCaR code and dataset for release. Our team is committed to ensuring the highest standards of quality and usability. We believe in the importance of making our research accessible and reproducible, allowing the community to explore and expand upon our work.

We appreciate your interest and patience. The release of the code and dataset will be announced shortly.
